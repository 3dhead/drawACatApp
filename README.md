# Draw A Cat

### The world's #1 online digital cat-drawing community

This is a side project I built to learn more about the Canvas API, and to get more familiar with the AngularJS
framework.

I've open-sourced the code in case anyone is interested to see how parts of it work. Disclaimer: I was learning
a lot about Angular (and JavaScript in general) as I built this, so don't be surprised to see some
inconsistencies in conventions and idioms in different parts of the code base, and patchy unit tests.

## Credits

I had a lot of help in building this application in the form of open-source tools, online resources, and
 inspiration. Here are some noteworthy sources:

 * [Hammer.js](http://eightmedia.github.io/hammer.js/) Makes integration with touch devices simple.
 * [AngularUI Project](http://angular-ui.github.io/) A bunch of indispensable tools for working with Angular.
 * [ng-Boilerplate](https://github.com/ngbp/ngbp) I based the structure of my code on this pattern.
 * [Sketch Toy](http://sketchtoy.com/) I was inspired by the sketchy line-art style of this amazing app.
 * [Freesound.org](http://www.freesound.org/) I used some sounds from here.
 * [Twisted Wave](https://twistedwave.com/online/)An amazing HTML5-based audio editor I used to snip the audio clips.
